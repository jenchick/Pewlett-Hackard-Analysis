# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to be proactive in preparing for the upcoming "silver tsnumai" expected to occur as a result of a mass number employees retiring soon.  First, I will determine the number of retiring employees per job title.  Next, I will identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, as it is best to "grow your own" to fill the gaps that will occur.

## Results
- Retiring Employees

  - The number of current employees with birthdates between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 who are expected to retire soon is 72,458.  

  - These employees fall into seven job titles, with the top two most impacted titles being "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff."

- Mentorship Program

  - It appears that 1,549 employees meet the criteria to participate in a mentorship program to help cover the employment gaps that are expected to occur.

  - There are 712 employees in this mentorship group that already have the title of "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff"

## Summary

The Silver Tsunami is expected to wipe out a large portion of Pewlett-Hackard's workforce.  There are not enough employees in the Mentorship Program to cover the large numbers of retiring employees.

Currently, the Mentorship Program eligibility is defined for employees with birthdates falling in the year 1965. This limits the pool of employees that can participate.  Opening the Mentorship Program to more employees will help cover this gap.  For example, capturing employees with birth years between 1965 and 1975 creates more participants and flexibility for advancement.

There may not be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  However, by evaluating the positions that are being lost, along with re-structuring of current job functions, it may be possible to fill the gaps created by those retiring.  This would be a large-scale job evaluation program, but it will be necessary to keep Pewlett Hackard running smoothly during this time of transition.
