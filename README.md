# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to be proactive in preparing for the upcoming "silver tsnumai" expected to occur as a result of a mass number employees retiring soon.  First, I will determine the number of retiring employees per job title.  Next, I will identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, as it is best to "grow your own" to fill the gaps that will occur.

## Results
- Retiring Employees

  - The number of current employees with birthdates between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 who are expected to retire soon is 72,458.  

  - These employees fall into seven job titles, with the top two most impacted titles being "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff."

- Mentorship Program

  - It appears that 1,549 employees meet the criteria to participate in a mentorship program to help cover the employment gaps that are expected to occur.

  - There are 712 employees in this mentorship group that already have the title of "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff"
